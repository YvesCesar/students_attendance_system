### About this project

This project arose from a demand in the city of Manaus/Brazil, where teachers reported problems with manual registration of student attendance. Given the data survey, we solved it with a scientific research: [School attendance management system for students through facial recognition](https://itegam-jetia.org/journal/index.php/jetia/article/view/838).
